# TODO:

- [ ] Finish writing up [springs](src/constraints/spring.ts).

  - [ ] Get direction between vectors.
  - [ ] Create vector with magnitude in direction.
  - [ ] Apply forces to actors assigned to spring.
  - [ ] Different constructor overload?  
         Rethink this, mark as completed if decided against.

- [ ] Better differentiation for [_behaviors_](src/behaviors/) and [_constraints_](src/constraints/).

- [ ] Add hard springs (spring only below/above a threshold).

- [ ] Basic front-end to play with the simulation.
